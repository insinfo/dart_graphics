/// loca - Index to Location
/// 
/// The indexToLoc table stores the offsets to the locations of the glyphs
/// in the font, relative to the beginning of the glyphData table.
/// In order to compute the length of the last glyph element,
/// there is an extra entry after the last valid index.
/// 
/// By definition, index zero points to the "missing character,"
/// which is the character that appears if a character is not found in the font.
/// The missing character is commonly represented by a blank box or a space.
/// If the font does not contain an outline for the missing character,
/// then the first and second offsets should have the same value.
/// This also applies to any other characters without an outline, such as the space character.
/// If a glyph has no outline, then loca[n] = loca[n+1].
/// 
/// There are two versions of this table, the short and the long.
/// The version is specified in the indexToLocFormat entry in the 'head' table.
